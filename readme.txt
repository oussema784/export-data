first you need to add a folder named database_export
in this first part i made 2 test 1 de connection preliminaire as a place holder for development later and export-tables.test.js as test unitaire for export-tables.js and i made export-table.js that works with that test 
PS: i did not test the connection and i did not try to connect to the data base for now
